## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft pastel lavender (#E6E6FA) to create a dreamy and inviting atmosphere, drawing inspiration from the user's preference for a Ghibli-inspired palette. In HSL this hue evokes a sense of calm, creativity, and imagination. 
- Background color: Very light gray (#F5F5F5), almost white, providing a clean and unobtrusive backdrop that allows the other colors and content to stand out.
- Accent color: Electric purple (#BF00FF) adds a touch of futuristic tech, while contrasting vividly against the pastel background to highlight key interactive elements.
- Headline font: 'Syne' (sans-serif) for a retro-futuristic, bold and expressive title.
- Body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) to maintain a minimalist, readable, and contemporary feel throughout the site.
- Use custom illustrations and potentially a mascot character to guide users.
- Employ subtle animations on scroll, hover, and click to enhance user interaction.
